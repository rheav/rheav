### Howdy! I'm Victor

**`Digital Artisan (Developer/Creator)`**



I'm an indie (and aspiring) front-end developer working in tech and learning everything by myself (and with the help of others, let's be real). Currently working as a Senior Field Software Engineer at VTEX, and studying and practicing front-end (with some back-end, as well) development consistently.

Creating stuff is something I love. Eventually, I create some useful stuff like [vtexSnitch](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vtexsnitch/ppkpkhgopkfhngdnkkdlnndfnalekjpd "vtexSnitch"), an extension for Chromium browsers that offers detailed information about VTEX stores, which is used by roughly **10% of VTEX team globally**.

 <summary><h3>ðŸŽ¢ Victors's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I started working with programming at the end of my degree. I was finishing my degree in Environmental Engineering, where I had very little experience with programming in general, and I decided that I wanted to learn how to program in order to create a website and make money online - well, *we gotta get paid, amirite?*  

My first completed project was a website in which I created the planets of the solar system via CSS and calculated the weight of the person on each planet. Everything worked in a way that, thinking about it now, I don't even know how.

But I was very happy and saw that "creating things" was something valuable to me.

So I started learning about HTML, CSS and JS, and went to work for a software house that developed e-commerces in Magento - but I went to work on the sales team.

I always kept studying, and after I started working at VTEX I had to improve myself to keep up with the pace of work. I focused more on JavaScript, APIs (both REST and GraphQL), and more recently on React.js and Node.js.

Nowadays, I study every day and do the iCodeThis.com and Codante.io challenges frequently to hone my skills, especially when it comes to creating beautiful interfaces.

And, as I said earlier, also create a lot of small projects to learn better about topics I studied recently.

Coding is where I can be the creator that, deep down, we all feel we are.

I'll get there.
